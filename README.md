## Technical Background

I've created websites and am currently hosting 2 live websites that I created with HTMl, CSS, and Javascript + JQuery that are being hosted on Google Cloud and Amazon. I've done a few projects related to Data Science, including data visualization for a personal project using the CDC database on COVID cases, and data visualization for my high school's cafe. This was all done in Jupyter Notebooks using matplotlib+seaborn and plotly primarily, along with the standard tools like numpy and pandas. Various other personal projects including a couple games.
